# Deadlines:

### October 1st - General Project Description

    Nothing detailed or over the top, just enough of a description to understand what algorithm/theme
    each problem will be focusing on. Include this as a README in your respective problem folder. 
    The use for this is that we can check to see if each division has a wide variety of problems
    and that people arent accidentally covering the same algorithm. Also we can yell at you if you 
    lag behind...jk ;).
    
    This is a soft deadline so its fine if you need to take a little longer to come up with a problem, just 
    shoot for the 1st and we will see what happens.
    

### October 15th - Final Submission

    We want to make sure there is plenty of time to review each problem and iron out any kinks. 
    This gives us exactly 1 week until the Codeathon to do just that. By this date you should 
    be able to theoretically include your problem in the codeathon if need be.
    
    
### October 22nd 7:00pm - Codeathon

    Obviously by this date your problem needs to be completely done; ready to solve without
    any hiccups or roadblocks. Hopefully everything will be done well before this date though!
